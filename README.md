# Reinforcement-Learning

This repo contains a few reinforcement learning projects I've done. 

Here, I tackle a few problems that include the OpenAI control suite and others.

- `OpenAI` contains from scratch implementations of Deep Q Networks and Double Deep Q Networks that solve some of the OpenAI control environments

- `MDP-Planning` contains implementations for the Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms as well as a comparison of performance
